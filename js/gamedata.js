// js/gameData.js
// The Island Update - Static Map
// this is a general rule for map making, intended as direction for you(AI), to follow. only edit the map if you are explicitly told. the edges of the map(empty space),-
// need to not ever be visible to the player, the player sees 14 tiles out, this means the map needs 14 tiles of unwalkable space around the edge of it, this can be in th-
// -e form of trees, ocean, scenery in general. try to make the maps feel hand crafted, not massive open spaces, not one tile narrow mazes(unless it's an actual maze zone or something)
//  and make the zone/map fit the theme of the biome or type of area it is. and where you place monsters you also need to make sure that they don't -
// block the path of the player to go past them (unless it's on purpose). those are all my rules for now, if you wanna get creative with it and try something that might be cool, go for it.
// and have landmarks for example, spaces for a town and a outpost in every zone, structures that would house monsters plus open forests that house wild animals.
// the world is the same for every player that opens the game, it's not randomly generated when it's launched.
// also to AI, if you make changes or adjustments to the game, please tick up the version indicator by 1
// also also to AI, if you make the code in the chat log too long, i am unable to apply changes to it, so if the change is long, make it in
// two or more diff review tabs please.
// marking is supposed to work like this:(i might change it later, for now it's this) when you mark first, you go to the target and start combat
// (i might make skills part of the marking system as well) when you kill that target, it will stay marked (both visually and functionally)
// if you only have one mark, when the monster dies, the character will wait for respawn and reengage.
// later you gain more marks and at that point, the marks should enter a invisible list, this is important for things like bosses later.
// when you have several monsters on the list, it will work like this, check which and engage with monsters that were added to that list in order
// if for example, you kill monster 1, then 2, then, 3, then 4, but monster 3 is a boss for example(right now all monsters are the same spawnrate in the code, but
// there will be variety later, for example if it's a boss monster) it will then skip monster 3 and go to 4, but, from that point on and until monster 3
// has been defeated once, monster 3 will gain priority over all monsters on the list, REASON FOR THIS: like i said, there are boss monsters
// and what would be preferable when several characters are marking the same boss and maybe the player is automating boss killing, is that, the characters
// are all attacking the boss at the same time, then when it dies, all the character go back to their set marked route, the boss takes 10 minutes to spawn, 
// so the characters are busy with other things for a while, then when it spawns again, example from before, if monster 3 isn't prioritized, one character might
// just happen to be on monster 2 right then, he defeats it and goes immediately to the boss, but another character might be on monster 4, if monster 3 wasn't
//  prioritised, he will have to kill monster 4, 1 and 2 before he goes to the boss. that is all to say, it's for the purpose of grouping characters if needed.
// the mark should show up on the target itself, not adjacent to it.
// when you mark a object of another type that you have marked already (for example, you have marks on monsters and then you mark a tree), 
// the first object type gets removed in favor of this new object, meaning you can only do one individual skill or activity at a time on each character.
// explanation about what "adjacent" means below:
// 010
// 1O1
// 010
// 0 = diagonal, 1 = adjacent!, O = object
